### Build a Reactive Data Streaming App with Python and Apache Kafka.


In this project, where we'll explore a fascinating concept: how to receive live notifications from a service that doesn't natively support them. Our goal is to create a solution that can track real-time changes from static data sources, such as YouTube's REST API. We'll use Python to fetch and process data, stream it into a Kafka topic, and analyze it with ksqlDB to detect important updates. Finally, we'll generate custom live notifications through Telegram. Get ready to dive into the world of real-time data streaming and witness how we bring data to life!

► Streams the data live from Python into a Kafka topic
► Analyzes the incoming data using ksqlDB to detect crucial changes
► Finally, sends out custom, live notifications through Telegram.
